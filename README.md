## Write a compiler for a new programming language in Java

### Step 1 - Create the Lexer
The first step to writing a compiler for a new programming language in Java is to create the Lexer. The Lexer is responsible for taking the source code of the programming language and transforming it into tokens. The Lexer will use a lexical analyzer, also known as a scanner, to scan through the characters of the source code and create tokens.

### Step 2 - Create the Parser
Once the Lexer has created the tokens, the next step is to create the Parser. The Parser is responsible for taking the tokens and constructing an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The AST is a tree-like structure that captures the structure of the source code. The Parser will use a context-free grammar to determine the structure of the source code and create the AST.

### Step 3 - Create the Semantic Analyzer
Once the Parser has created the AST, the next step is to create the Semantic Analyzer. The Semantic Analyzer is responsible for performing semantic analysis on the AST to ensure that the source code is semantically correct. This includes checking for type compatibility, variable declarations, and other semantic checks.

### Step 4 - Create the Code Generator
The final step to compiling the source code is to generate the executable code. The Code Generator is responsible for taking the AST and generating the executable code. The Code Generator can generate code for any target platform, such as x86, ARM, or any other platform.

### Step 5 - Test and Debug
The final step to writing a compiler for a new programming language in Java is to test and debug the compiler. This includes testing the Lexer, Parser, Semantic Analyzer, and Code Generator to ensure that the compiler is working correctly. Additionally, any bugs or errors that are found should be fixed.
